# Gemstone Price Prediction

This project predicts gemstone prices based on features such as weight, color, and clarity using machine learning techniques. The system includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and experiment tracking using MLflow, with data fetched from MongoDB and integrated with tools like Comet, DVC, and Prefect.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training using **Linear Regression**, **Lasso**, **Ridge**, and **ElasticNet**
- Model evaluation using metrics like **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **RÂ²**
- **MLflow** integration for experiment tracking
- **MongoDB** integration for fetching data
- **DVC** for data version control
- **Comet** for experiment tracking and visualization
- **Prefect** for workflow management

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/om2007464/End-to-End-MLOPs-project.git
   cd End-to-End-MLOPs-project


Create a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

Install the project dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Application

Web UI: To start the Flask web application, run
```
python app.py
```

Run the training pipeline: To run the model training pipeline, execute:
```
python gemstone_training_pipeline.py
```
## MongoDB Configuration

Ensure MongoDB is installed and running. Use the MongoDB URI to connect and fetch data into the project. Update your DataIngestion.py or any relevant configuration with your MongoDB URI.

## MLflow Configuration

MLflow is integrated for tracking experiments, logging model parameters, metrics, and saving the best models. To start using MLflow:

Make sure to configure the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI properly.
The default is usually local, but it can be changed to a remote server if needed.

## Tools Used

- **MLflow**: For tracking experiments and logging models  
- **MongoDB**: For storing and retrieving data  
- **Comet**: For experiment visualization and collaboration  
- **DVC**: For version control of datasets and models  
- **Prefect**: For orchestrating and scheduling workflows
